## Process Overview

Here's the complete infrastructure deployment workflow:

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Foundation
1. **[Prepare Proxmox VE](#step-1-prepare-proxmox-ve)** - Set up secure access for Terraform
2. **[Set up your workstation](#step-2-workstation-setup)** - Install and configure required tools
3. **[Configure Terraform](#step-3-terraform-configuration)** - Create infrastructure code
4. **[Deploy and test](#step-4-first-deployment)** - Verify infrastructure works end-to-end

### Phase 2: Configuration Management
5. **[Configure VMs with Ansible](#step-5-ansible-configuration-management)** - Set up automated configuration management
6. **[Validation](#validation-checklist)** - Comprehensive testing before service deployment

### Phase 3: Service Deployment
7. **[Deploy Services](services-deployment.md)** - GNS3, monitoring, DNS, and other lab services

**Expected time**: 2-3 hours for complete setup (Phase 1-2)

> üí° **Note**: This guide covers **Phase 1-2** (infrastructure + configuration management). Service deployment guides are separate.

## Step 1: Prepare Proxmox VE

This step configures Proxmox VE with a dedicated user, secure authentication, and VM template for Terraform.

> üìñ **Detailed Guide**: For complete instructions with troubleshooting, see **[Proxmox Setup Guide](proxmox-setup.md)**

### 1.1 Quick Overview

You'll need to:
1. **Access** Proxmox web interface at `https://your-proxmox-ip:8006`
2. **Create** a dedicated terraform user with proper permissions  
3. **Generate** an API token for secure authentication
4. **Build** an Ubuntu 24.04 VM template for cloning
5. **Test** that everything works

### 1.2 Key Commands

Here are the essential commands (run these in Proxmox shell):

```bash
# Create role and user
pveum role add TerraformProv -privs "VM.Allocate,VM.Audit,VM.Backup,VM.Clone,VM.Config.CDROM,VM.Config.CPU,VM.Config.Cloudinit,VM.Config.Disk,VM.Config.HWType,VM.Config.Memory,VM.Config.Network,VM.Config.Options,VM.Console,VM.Migrate,VM.PowerMgmt,VM.Snapshot,Datastore.AllocateSpace,Datastore.Audit,Pool.Allocate,Pool.Audit,SDN.Use,Sys.Audit,Sys.Console"
pveum user add terraform@pve --password "SecurePassword123!"
pveum aclmod / -user terraform@pve -role TerraformProv

# Create API token (SAVE THIS VALUE!)
pveum user token add terraform@pve terraform-token --privsep=0
```

```bash
# Create Ubuntu template
cd /tmp
wget https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/noble/current/noble-server-cloudimg-amd64.img
qm create 9001 --memory 2048 --cores 2 --name ubuntu2404-cloud --net0 virtio,bridge=vmbr0
qm importdisk 9001 noble-server-cloudimg-amd64.img local-lvm
qm set 9001 --scsihw virtio-scsi-pci --scsi0 local-lvm:vm-9001-disk-0
qm set 9001 --ide2 local-lvm:cloudinit --boot c --bootdisk scsi0 --serial0 socket --vga serial0
qm template 9001
rm noble-server-cloudimg-amd64.img
```

### 1.3 Validation

Test API authentication works:

```bash
curl -k -H 'Authorization: PVEAPIToken=terraform@pve!terraform-token=YOUR_TOKEN_VALUE' \
  https://YOUR_PROXMOX_IP:8006/api2/json/version
```

‚úÖ **Success**: You should see: `{"data":{"version":"9.0.3"...}}`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Issues?** The [detailed Proxmox guide](proxmox-setup.md) has complete troubleshooting for authentication problems, privilege errors, and template creation issues.

## Step 2: Workstation Setup

This step installs the required tools on your local machine and creates SSH keys for VM access.

> üìñ **Detailed Guide**: For platform-specific instructions, corporate network setup, and troubleshooting, see **[Workstation Setup Guide](workstation-setup.md)**

### 2.1 Install Required Tools

**Windows (using Chocolatey - recommended):**
```powershell
# Install Chocolatey package manager
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

# Install required tools
choco install terraform git vscode openssh -y
```

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install terraform git openssh-client -y

# macOS (with Homebrew)
brew install terraform git openssh
```

### 2.2 Generate SSH Key

```bash
# Generate SSH key for secure VM access
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/proxmox_key

# Display public key (save this - you'll need it for Terraform!)
cat ~/.ssh/proxmox_key.pub
```

### 2.3 Verify Installation

```bash
terraform version  # Should show v1.5+
git --version     # Should show installed version  
ssh -V           # Should show OpenSSH version
```

> üí° **Tip**: Save your SSH public key somewhere safe - you'll need to paste it into the Terraform configuration.

## Step 3: Terraform Configuration

This step creates the infrastructure-as-code configuration files and sets up your specific environment values.

> üìñ **Complete Reference**: See [Terraform Configuration Guide](terraform-configuration.md) for all configuration options, examples, and advanced setups.

### 3.1 Get the Repository

```bash
# If you cloned this repo already:
cd vuv-lab-infra

# If starting fresh:
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd vuv-lab-infra
```

### 3.2 Configure Your Environment

Create your environment-specific settings:

```bash
# Copy the example configuration
cp terraform/terraform.tfvars.example terraform/terraform.tfvars

# Edit with your specific values
# (Use any text editor like nano, vim, or VS Code)
nano terraform/terraform.tfvars
```

**Your `terraform.tfvars` should look like:**
```hcl
proxmox_host              = "192.168.1.91"      # Your Proxmox IP
proxmox_api_token_secret  = "your-token-here"   # From Step 1
proxmox_node              = "pve"               # Your node name
template_name             = "ubuntu2404-cloud"  # Template from Step 1
ssh_public_key            = "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAI... your-email@example.com"  # From Step 2
```

### 3.3 Initialize and Test

```bash
cd terraform

# Initialize Terraform (downloads providers)
terraform init

# Validate configuration syntax
terraform validate

# Preview what will be created
terraform plan
```

‚úÖ **Success**: `terraform plan` should show it will create 1 VM without errors.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Problems?** The [Terraform configuration guide](terraform-configuration.md) covers all file structures, troubleshooting provider issues, and variable validation.

## Step 4: First Deployment

Now for the exciting part - let's deploy a test VM to verify your entire setup works end-to-end!

### 4.1 Deploy Test VM

```bash
# Deploy your first VM!
terraform apply

# Type 'yes' when prompted
```

**What happens:**
- Terraform connects to Proxmox using your API token
- Clones your Ubuntu template to create a new VM
- Configures cloud-init with your SSH key
- Starts the VM and waits for it to be ready

**Expected time:** 2-3 minutes

### 4.2 Test VM Access

```bash
# Get the VM's IP address
terraform output vm_ips

# SSH into your new VM (replace with actual IP)
ssh -i ~/.ssh/proxmox_key ubuntu@<VM_IP>

# Test basic functionality
uptime
sudo apt update
exit
```

‚úÖ **Success**: You should be able to SSH in and run commands!

### 4.3 Cleanup Test Resources

Since this is just a test, clean up the resources:

```bash
# Remove the test VM
terraform destroy

# Type 'yes' when prompted
```

> üí° **What we just proved**: Your infrastructure foundation works! Terraform can authenticate to Proxmox, clone templates, create VMs, and you can access them securely.

---

## üéØ **What's Next: Configuration Management**

**Congratulations!** You now have working infrastructure, but the VMs are "blank slates" that need configuration. This is where **Ansible** comes in.

### Why Configuration Management?

Your VMs currently have:
- ‚úÖ Basic Ubuntu installation
- ‚úÖ SSH access with your key
- ‚ùå No application software
- ‚ùå No security hardening  
- ‚ùå No service configuration
- ‚ùå No team access management

**Ansible will configure your VMs** with proper users, security settings, and prepare them for service deployment.

### Ready for Phase 2?

**Continue to: [Step 5: Ansible Configuration Management](#step-5-ansible-configuration-management)** ‚¨áÔ∏è

---

## Step 5: Ansible Configuration Management

Now that you have working VM deployments, it's time to set up configuration management with Ansible.

> üìñ **Complete Reference**: See [Ansible Setup Guide](ansible-setup.md) for detailed installation, team SSH key management, and troubleshooting.

### 5.1 Install Ansible

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ansible -y
```

**Windows with WSL2:**
```bash
sudo apt install ansible python3-pip -y
```

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install ansible
```

**Windows with Chocolatey:**
```powershell
choco install ansible -y
```

### 5.2 Prepare for Configuration Management

```bash
# Navigate to the ansible directory
cd ansible

# Deploy some VMs for configuration (using your working Terraform)
cd ../terraform
terraform apply  # Deploy a few VMs for testing

# Get VM IP addresses
terraform output vm_ips
```

### 5.3 Bootstrap VMs for Ansible

Update the inventory with your actual VM IPs:

```bash
# Edit inventory with your VM IPs
nano inventory/hosts

# Example entry:
# gns3-server ansible_host=192.168.1.20
```

Run the bootstrap playbook to create the `lab` user:

```bash
# Bootstrap VMs (creates 'lab' user with passwordless sudo)
ansible-playbook -k playbooks/bootstrap.yml

# When prompted, enter password for your initial VM user (e.g., ubuntu)
```

### 5.4 Verify Ansible Management

```bash
# Test connectivity to all managed VMs
ansible all -m ping

# Should return SUCCESS for all hosts
```

‚úÖ **Success**: Your VMs are now ready for configuration management!

### 5.5 Apply Basic Configuration

```bash
# Run system updates on all VMs
ansible-playbook playbooks/system_updates.yml

# Apply security hardening
ansible-playbook playbooks/security_hardening.yml
```

> üí° **What we just accomplished**: VMs are now configured with proper user accounts, security settings, and ready for service deployment.
