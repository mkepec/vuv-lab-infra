# Task ID: 9
# Title: Comprehensive Service Integration
# Status: not_started
# Dependencies: 4, 6, 7, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate all deployed services with DNS for proper name resolution, configure routing through Traefik, and ensure comprehensive monitoring for all components.
# Details:
Update DNS records in the BIND server for all deployed services to ensure proper name resolution. Configure Traefik to route traffic to all web-based services, including containerized services on Docker hosts. Ensure all services are discoverable by Prometheus for metrics collection and implement service health checks.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that all services are accessible via their fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) through the Traefik reverse proxy. Check Prometheus and Grafana to confirm that all service metrics are being collected and health checks are reporting correctly.
