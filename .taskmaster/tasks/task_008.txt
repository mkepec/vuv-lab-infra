# Task ID: 8
# Title: Docker Host Implementation
# Status: not_started
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Provision Docker host VMs using Terraform and configure Docker Engine with Ansible playbooks.
# Details:
Create Terraform resource definitions for Docker host VMs with specified resource allocations (4GB RAM, 2 vCPUs, 30GB disk). Develop Ansible playbooks for Docker Engine installation and basic configuration (e.g., registry mirrors, daemon settings).

# Test Strategy:
SSH into the provisioned Docker hosts. Verify that the Docker daemon is running correctly. Run a simple container (e.g., `docker run hello-world`) to confirm functionality.
