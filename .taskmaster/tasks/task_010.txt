# Task ID: 10
# Title: Automated Backup Procedures
# Status: not_started
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement automated backup procedures for VMs and configurations using Proxmox built-in tools and ensure version control for all infrastructure code.
# Details:
Configure automated backup jobs within Proxmox for all critical VMs. Ensure that all Terraform state files, Ansible playbooks, and service configurations (e.g., BIND zone files) are consistently version-controlled in the Git repository. Document basic recovery procedures.

# Test Strategy:
Perform a test backup and restore operation for a non-critical VM to validate the backup process. Verify that all configuration files are correctly committed and retrievable from the Git repository.
