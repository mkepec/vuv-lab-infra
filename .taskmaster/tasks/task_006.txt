# Task ID: 6
# Title: Traefik Reverse Proxy Implementation
# Status: not_started
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Deploy a Traefik reverse proxy VM, configure it for service discovery, SSL/TLS termination with self-signed certificates, and enable HTTPS access for web services.
# Details:
Create a Terraform resource definition for the Traefik reverse proxy VM. Develop an Ansible playbook for Traefik installation and configuration, including service discovery mechanisms. Implement SSL/TLS termination using self-signed certificates. Configure HTTPS access for services like the GNS3 web interface and other future web-based services.

# Test Strategy:
Access the GNS3 web interface via the Traefik HTTPS endpoint. Verify that SSL/TLS termination is working correctly and the self-signed certificate is presented. Check the Traefik dashboard for service routing status.
